a button

a potentiometer

so how this works is it works of the peppers ghost effect which works of the internal refraction effect. a common place u see this effect when your window starts acting like a mirror at certain angles

how to make it 
take your oled and stick it on a piece of foam or cardboard and then stick the lens the flatter side facing the screen approximately
