a button

a potentiometer

so how this works is it works of the peppers ghost effect which works of the internal refraction effect. a common place u see this effect when your window starts acting like a mirror at certain angles

how to make it 
take your oled and stick it on a piece of foam or cardboard and then stick the lens the flatter side facing the screen approximately 1-2 cm away from the screen .

and then upload ar time.ino to the esp 

if u havent setup youre esp yet follow this tutorial

https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide

now wear the glasses and hold the lens facing towards the screen and move aro0und the arrangement till u get the best image

for me placing it parrallel and 2cm away from the screen gave me the best image while wearing(my eyes do have a slight power of 0.5 )

now just glue that arrangement on and glue the esp8266 on to the glasses and power the esp using a 5v battery using ther vin and gnd ports

now youre done you have a simple ar glasses which shows u the time,date and day

u can try your hand it and modify the scripts to show what u like. like imgs and animations
